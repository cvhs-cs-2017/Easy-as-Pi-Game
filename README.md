Games using Pygame
Thanks to Sentdex for helping me learn this subject
In the robots game, just press the left and right keys to move left and right, respectively
In the Pong game:
   In the 2 player version, left paddle player uses w and s to move the paddle up and down, while the right paddle player uses up and down    arrows
   
   In the 1 player version, just  use the up and down keys to move.
